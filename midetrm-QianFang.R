# Comments
# The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter.
# The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also also 1/lambda.
# for example, lambda equals 2, we get 20 exponentail waiting times with average waiting time equals to 1/2=0.5
